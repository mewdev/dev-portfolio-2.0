e c h o boomer is a seven piece Space Pop/Jazz band led by bassist Beate Wiesinger. The term „echoboomer“ refers to sociology and actually describes the generation born between 1970 and 1990. In this context though, it means a lot more: e c h o boomer is a laboratory for composition and improvisation, for ideas of different music and set-ups. In late 2019 the band released their first album Aliens On Board, which turned out to be a very colourful piece of music: delicately composed soundscapes mix with noise improvisations, song-alike structures reside on rhythmically intriguing grounds without missing any clarity. Aliens On Board was voted as one of the top 10 jazz albums in 2019 by viennese magazine FALTER. E c h o boomer can sound big, fragile, funny, heavy, deep and certainly makes an attempt to surprise their audience.
